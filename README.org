* Tilin Window Manager
Yes very creative name, i do not expect this to be a very big project
im doing this just for fun, this windog manager is not even Tiling yet
im workin on it, i thought using the X11 libraries was difficult but,
looking some examples it is being kinda fun.
* Do Not Use This Yet!
may not work. yes very minimal.
